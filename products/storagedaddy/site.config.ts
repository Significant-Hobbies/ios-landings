    { question: "Why can totals differ from macOS Storage?", answer: "Allocated and logical sizes differ. Shared APFS blocks, snapshots, protected files and scan scope also affect totals. Allocated bytes are not a guarantee of space reclaimed." },
    { question: "Do I need Full Disk Access?", answer: "It is optional and enables broader coverage. Protected or unreadable locations may still be skipped. A folder scan is a useful starting point." },
