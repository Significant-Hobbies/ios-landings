  faqs: [
    { question: "Can I download it now?", answer: "Not yet. This is a preview of the working local Mac app, not a public release. No App Store or TestFlight availability is claimed." },
    { question: "Can it kill a process?", answer: "Yes, after review. Normal and force stops are separate choices, guarded by process identity and user restrictions. Stopping a process can interrupt work or lose unsaved data." },
    { question: "What about apps running in the background?", answer: "Inspect visible background processes and app helpers alongside foreground workloads. Compare their CPU and resident RAM, see how long a process has been running, and inspect available identity and startup metadata before deciding what to stop. Background does not mean unnecessary: macOS and your apps rely on many of these helpers." },
    { question: "Why did something come back after I stopped it?", answer: "An app, login item or service manager may launch another process. PerformanceDaddy shows matching launch-configuration clues and watches for matching executables after stops requested through the app. A match is not proof of an automatic restart or its cause. This history stays in memory for up to 24 hours and clears when you quit; the app does not disable startup items for you." },
    { question: "Which agents does it recognize?", answer: "Local metadata recognition covers Codex, Claude, Devin, Hermes, Aider, Gemini CLI, OpenCode and Cursor CLI. It cannot identify every wrapped launch or tell whether a conversation is active." },
    { question: "Does every report prove the root cause?", answer: "No. Reports separate observed signals, thresholds not met and missing evidence. CPU activity is not proof of why a task was slow. Network latency, blocked threads, GPU activity and disk latency are not measured by the standard recording." },
    { question: "Can it read fan speed or temperature?", answer: "The app reports macOS thermal state and available power evidence. Raw fan RPM, temperature and fan controls are not implemented." }
