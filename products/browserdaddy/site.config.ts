    { question: "Can I download BrowserDaddy?", answer: "Not yet. The native Mac app is in development, without a public download or App Store listing. This site documents the current product and its limits." },
    { question: "Which browsers can it read?", answer: "History discovery covers Chromium-family browsers and profiles, Firefox and Safari where their local stores are readable. Active-tab support is narrower and depends on browser scripting and per-browser Automation permission." },
    { question: "Are visits the same as time spent?", answer: "No. Browser history records visits. The attention watcher measures foreground activity and input-idle state from when it starts. It cannot reconstruct past attention or measure a tab merely because it is visible on another monitor." },
    { question: "Does it modify my browser history?", answer: "No. Collection reads browser stores into a separate local archive. BrowserDaddy is not a history cleaner and does not delete visits from your browser." },
    { question: "Does it send data to a service?", answer: "Optional tagging uses classifier.dev. When enabled and run, domain classification includes domain names and selected page titles; page classification includes hostnames, URL paths and titles. These can contain sensitive information. The rest of the browsing archive is local; the website's own hosting and footer behavior is described in Privacy." },
    { question: "What about private browsing?", answer: "BrowserDaddy is not intended to recover private browsing. Private-window exclusion in the live attention watcher has not completed release qualification. Avoid using the preview for sensitive private browsing until that protection is verified." }
