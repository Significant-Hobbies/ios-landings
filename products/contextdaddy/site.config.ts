    { question: "Can I download ContextDaddy?", answer: "Yes. The beta is a free, signed and notarized Apple-silicon Mac build, distributed directly — no account, checkout, App Store or TestFlight listing. Updates are manual downloads for now." },
    { question: "Does it change my agent setup?", answer: "No. ContextDaddy is read-only: it never edits agent configuration, installs skills or modifies files. Review panels can copy an agent-ready brief for you to act on yourself." },
    { question: "Which agents does it cover?", answer: "Discovery and policy models cover the major coding-agent runtimes, including Codex, Claude, Cursor, Devin and Grok. Non-auto skills show how to invoke them; policy is labelled explicit or derived." },
    { question: "What does the usage view measure?", answer: "Local agent-log history via the bundled ccusage helper, provider allowance through installed provider CLIs when you ask, and OpenTelemetry signals from a compatible local collector. Missing sources are shown as unavailable, not zero activity." },
    { question: "Does anything leave my Mac?", answer: "Provider allowance checks use installed CLIs and OpenTelemetry reads a loopback collector. The app has no account, sync or telemetry upload of its own." }
